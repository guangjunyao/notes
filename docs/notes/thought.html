世界是非线性的，人的大脑为了适应环境，会常选择用线性的思维来判断周围的环境，从而做出比较机械式的决定&#x2013;《思维的快与慢》。例如人们以为成功是有秘诀的，所有的成功是有一套模式的，从而从成功人士身上提取一堆特质，并认为只要具有这些特质，自然而然就会成功了。这也是为什么畅销书一直火爆的秘密。但是人们忘记了，成功并没有范式，同样具有这样物征的人也许有很多很多，有这样特征的人失败的人并没有常被人们提起，而因为幸存者偏差被遗忘了。同样的道理，线性的模型认为经过了一些漏斗选择出来的股票，将来有大概率的机会会上涨或者反弹，但是这些alpha在现实世界上往往经不起考验，因为还有beta的因素在影响股票的价格。
打破线性思维，用非线性模型来思考，就像Taleb在《黑天鹅》里面说的一样，当人们见到的大多数天鹅是白色的，就认为所有的天鹅是白色的，当黑天鹅出现的时候，人们才想起天鹅还有黑色的。逆向思维，当提出一个假设以后，通过反面的例子去否定他。

科学的产生是经验的总结，人的习惯性思维是去寻找一些规律，好利用这些规律来辅助生产。
</p>

<p>
但是在投资领域里面并没有万金油的规律。这个跟黑天鹅现象很像，人们直到看到黑天鹅出现时，才知道原来天鹅不全都是白色的。一个规则运用的场景，次数很多，不代表这就是应用背后的规律。
</p>

<p>
投资时避免选择拥护的交易，逆向思维，用排除法去除大众的想法，而应该选择去寻找Anormaly，风险小，收益高。

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
When applied specifically to economics there are multiple factors to consider when understanding a zero-sum game. Zero-sum game assumes a version of perfect competition and perfect information; that is, both opponents in the model have all the relevant information to make an informed decision. To take a step back, most transactions or trades are inherently non zero-sum games because when two parties agree to trade they do so with the understanding that the goods or services they are receiving are more valuable than the goods or services they are trading for it, after transaction costs. This is called positive-sum, and most transactions fall under this category.
</p>

<p>
Accumenting information is a key element at trading so that a lot of economic resources are put on the research. Most of the time the institutional investors have more and depth information than the individual investors, this makes the game not a fair one. And the disposition effect makes the unbalance evern worse, frequent buying high and selling low bothers investors, which brings loss to them.
</p>

<p>
The increasement of the corporate value will bring more value to investors as long as the stock prices go up over long term as the aggregate of economic expansion.
</p>

<p>
However, this is different from the poker game, where winners' gain is losers' loss.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
There are two competition factors that affect people's career expectation at the financial technology industry, one is industry advancing by the era, beginners/newbies bring more resource including new knowledge and more capital, you have to learn more knlowlege to compete with other peers. The other one is the threat of Artifical Intellegience, most of the nowadays jobs will be eliminated by AI because of their high efficiency in the next few decades. Imaging the competition from AI that will be more productive than average people by many times, it's not hard to get the conclusion that you need study much much harder to face the competition of AI in the future.
</p>

<p>
The benefit of not being eliminated, or still having a job in the future is huge. It means you can still produce productivity and effort from a job, which is not token by robots or other competitors. This high payoff will bring those survivors enough resources to get people the most wanted dream since thousand years ago, longervity. In order to prove that you can still produce good for the society, you need a talent job making value. Otherwise, your future social function can not be approved by others, and the natural aging will be an end. Longervity can brought by the high curing level, which can cancel the aging or even better, modifying your body organs.

<p>
When you read a textbook or listen to a lecture, it's easy to trick yourself into thinking you understand it. You can't directly observe your state of understanding. You need to find ways to test your understanding, for instance:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>try to write out the definitions, theorems, proofs, etc. from memory</li>
<li>do some exercises</li>
<li>try to explain the ideas in your own words</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>One trick I've found to make it more obvious is parallel reading: read two different (possibly unrelated) things in parallel. Read a few paragraphs of one, then a few paragraphs of the other, and so on. Each time you switch, try to recall what the previous stretch of text was about. Switching forces it out of your working memory (the kind that stores words and images for short times). Therefore, you find out whether the material actually made it into your long-term memory.</b>

How to efficiently learn things from a meeting or presentation.
</p>

<p>
If the presenten gives something I know, connect it with my objective. For example, Zhongwei and me all know mean reversion strategy, how is LSTM and PCA used on this subject.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to know every details about the presentation, connect it with your own working field by utilizing them on your project.
</p>

<p>
Machine learning is for ungifted people. Feeding the model big trunk of data, let it working out a model/prediction method for you.
</p>

<p>
Learning new technology or knowledge is the same principle, connect your previous knowledge or understanding or experience, predict the unknown field. If the prediction is right, then you have the optimized understanding of that thing, if not, you correct or re-calibrate it.
</p>

<p>
Three key points should be minded in Machine learning: objective function, optimization process, prediction.

The challenge financial analysts facing is how to extract useful information from big data, which includes news articles, financial statements, tables, graphs etc. Our objective is to provide them a tool to analyze these information with an understandable workflow in order to increase the efficiency to solve selecting strategy and portfolio, making investment decision.

One of the tools that can be utilized for increasing workflow decision is to tell machines to understand human needs, which is referred as NaturalLanguageProcessing(NLP) pipline.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Students set aside a decade or two of their lives to learn (or at least pretend to learn) things long before they have any idea why they'd need to know them.</li>
<li>Students have little or no control over their course of studies, since the educational system processes far too many students to be able to personalize the curriculum.</li>
<li>Even at the college level, course bulletins provide almost no guidance about what a class covers or why it's useful (lest too many trees be killed).</li>
<li>The choice of topics favors things which can be easily tested, such as rote manipulations.</li>
<li>Since the whole class must progress through the curriculum at the same rate, it's impossible to go back to repair gaps in students' knowledge. This means the only workable strategy is to rehearse each topic endlessly before moving on to the next one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
these compromises mean there's often <b>little intrinsic motivation</b> to learn the material, hence the need for external motivators like mandatory homeworks and exams.
</p>

<p>
But notice that all the items in the above list are <b>responses to various constraints which don't apply when you are teaching yoruself.</b>
</p>

<p>
The main way to stay motivated is to learn topics you're interested in learning.

<h4 id="orgheadline28"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.2</span> Metacognition</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
Learning without a teacher presents many challenges, but in my experience the biggest is that you don't get any feedback. (That is, unless you're using a service with interactive exercises, such as Khan Academy.) Without feedback, you need to monitor your own understanding to decide if you're done or which gaps still need to be filled. The ability to introspect on and manage your own thought processes is known as metacognition.
</p>

<p>
You need to find ways to test your understanding, for instance:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>try to write out the definitions, theorems, proofs, etc. from memory</li>
<li>do some exercises</li>
<li>try to explain the ideas in your own words</li>
</ul>

<p>
You might have had the experience while reading that your mind wandered and you completely missed everything in the last few paragraphs. It's hard to notice your lack of attention. One trick I've found to make it more obvious is parallel reading: read two different (possibly unrelated) things in parallel. Read a few paragraphs of one, then a few paragraphs of the other, and so on. Each time you switch, try to recall what the previous stretch of text was about. Switching forces it out of your working memory (the kind that stores words and images for short times). Therefore, you find out whether the material actually made it into your long-term memory.
</p>

<p>
If you're studying on your own using multiple resources, the clashes of notation might be confusing. But I often find that confusion about notation reflects an underlying confusion about ideas, and that having to confront multiple notations ultimately helps my understanding.

<h3 id="orgheadline31"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Integrating NLP with GS<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2018-01-26 Fri&gt;</span></span></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
The overview picture of GS is to help analysts searching strategy ideas, adaptively constructing data input(X,y), and incrementally backtesting strategies.
</p>

<p>
First of all, strategy research idea comes from various sort of unstructured data like research paper/reports, news events. Where does an analyst start from when we facing a tons of structured and unstructured data?
</p>

<p>
NLP can transfer unstructured documentations into structured graph data, therefore extracting multi perspective understanding of entities, views, concepts, ideas, events from research paper/reports, announcement, news, books, etc. Then it provides users more adaptive next steps research recommendation, helping them to finish the strategy construction and backtesting based on different context. For example, what data they use, the brief ideas behind the paper, what models/algorithms they can use, how the results look like(positive or negative).
</p>

<p>
A more detailed example is the Black-litterman model research. The Black-Litterman model uses a Bayesian approach to combine the subjective views of an investor regarding the expected returns of one or more assets with the market equilibrium vector of expected returns (the prior distribution) to form a new, mixed estimate of expected returns.
</p>

<p>
The model starts with the equilibrium assumption that the asset allocation of a representative agent should be proportional to the market values of the available assets, and then modifies that to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Such views can be extracted using NLP tools like Named Entity Recognition from various documents under the most recent sector condition.
</p>

<p>
Another useful NLP tool is information sentiment analysis. Web crawling can extract hot and the most user concerned events/results from different web sources using a keyword. Such a keyword can also be highly adaptive to user and associated with its relevance. NLP can process web crawling information, extracting entities, relationship, plugging such unique financial knowledge graph into the overall database, thus continuously tracking the subjects.
</p>

<p>
Based on hot events or keywords, documents classification help can extract topics and incrementally searching information from previous results, thus recommending plentiful relevant results from one context to another. This technology gives more possibilities to understand the most cared user question and attempts.
