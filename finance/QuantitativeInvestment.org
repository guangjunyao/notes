* Event study
[[file:./EventStudy.org][EventStudy]]
The Event Study module is designed to evaluate the impact of discrete events on future returns. Classic examples of these events are stock splits, earnings surprises, index additions and deletions. The event study attempts to determine if there is a significant abnormal return which can be attributed to the occurrence of the event.

* Performance analytics:

** percentage change:
$$percentage change(P_n) = value / value.shift(1)$$
** cumlative return:
$$total_return = (1+P_1)*(1+P_2)*...(1+P_n) - 1.0$$
** annualized return:
$$annualized return = (1 + cumulative return)^(252/periods) - 1.0$$
$$(annualized return + 1)^(periods/252) = 1 + cumulative return$$
** annualized volatility:
$\sigma = standard deviation of returns(degree of freedom N -1)$
$$annualized volatility = \sigma * \sqrt(periods)$$
** annualized downrisk volatility:
** downside standard deviation:
Downside deviation is a measure of downside risk that focuses on returns that fall below a minimum threshold or minimum acceptable return (MAR). It is used in the calculation of a risk measure known as the Sortino Ratio.
$$MAR=\sqrt{E[(X-E[X])^2]1{X<E[X]}])^0.5}
** sharpe ratio:
$$sharpe ratio = (E[annual returns] - interest rate)/\sigma_annual$$
** sortino ratio:
$$SR = \div{annual return - R_f, Downside Risk}$$
** return standard deviation:
$\sigma = standard deviation of returns(degree of freedom N -1)$
