* Querying Relational Database
** Query Language
- Relational Algebra
formal
- SQL

* Relational Algebra
** select, project, join
- query on set of reltations produces relations as a result
- use operators to filter, slice, combine results.
- Select operator:
$\sigma_condition(Expression)$
$\s GPA > 3.7 ^ HS < 1000 Student$
- Project operators: picks cerntain columns
$\pi_Apply1,Apply2,...,Applyn(Expression)$
$ \pi_ID apply$
$\pi_ID,StudentName(\sigma_GPA > 3.7 Student)$
*** cross-product:
- E1 * E2
*** natural join
*** theta join
** Set operators, renaming, notation
*** Union operator
- List of college and student names
*** Intersection operator
- Join:
  $E1 \join E2
***
* SQL
** Basic select statement
** Table variables and set operators
*** Union, intersect, except
