| Lee and Chung (1996) | 	Investigating the effects of price limits on stock market efficiency. | 	Korean Stock Exchange: the opening and closing price series from January 1990 to December 1993 of 30 active individual stocks which experience considerable numbers of price limits hits are selected by the highest turnover ratio from different industry | 	1. OLS regression analysis 2. Regression analyses are performed using GARCH (1,1) procedure Comparing the results from original data with the results from proxy data. Proxy data means that on the day of closing price hitting the limits, the closing price is not the equilibrium price which is measured by the next dayâ€™s opening price.	 | There are positive serial correlations between returns due to the price limits, suggesting the rejection of market efficiency. When removing the effects of price limits, the serial correlations between returns disappear. |
