* Singular Value Decomposition
$$A_{m*n} = U_{m*m} \Sigma_{m*n} V_{n*n}^T$$

In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a positive semidefinite normal matrix (for example, a symmetric matrix with positive eigenvalues) to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition. It has many useful applications in signal processing and statistics.

Formally, the singular value decomposition of an $m\times n$ real or complex matrix $\mathbf {M}$  is a factorization of the form ${\displaystyle \mathbf {U\Sigma V^{*}} }$, where $\mathbf {U}$  is an $m\times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a $ m\times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $\mathbf {V}$  is an $ n\times n$ real or complex unitary matrix. The diagonal entries $\sigma _{i}$ of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ are known as the singular values of $\mathbf {M}$ . The columns of $ \mathbf {U}$  and the columns of $ \mathbf {V}$  are called the left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of $\mathbf {M}$ , respectively.

The singular value decomposition can be computed using the following observations:

The left-singular vectors of M are a set of orthonormal eigenvectors of MM∗.
The right-singular vectors of M are a set of orthonormal eigenvectors of M∗M.
The non-zero singular values of M (found on the diagonal entries of Σ) are the square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of both M∗M and MM∗.
Applications that employ the SVD include computing the pseudoinverse, least squares fitting of data, multivariable control, Matrix Approximation, and determining the rank, range and null space of a matrix.
