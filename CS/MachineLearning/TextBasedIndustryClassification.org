* Text based network industries and endogenous product differentiation

** summary:
- product similarity industries classification.
This paper develops new time-varying industry classification using text-based analysis of firm product description filed with the SEC.

- empirical benefits
product differentiation, competitive intensity and product offering following industry shocks.

** ideas:
- product words describing features and bundles of products of each firm.

- how similar each firm is to every other firm by calculating firm-by-firm pairwise word similarity scores using the product words.

** Objective and Methodology: From Words to Industry Classifications
*** Objective:
To capture the relatedness of firms based on their product offerings to customers using a flexible network approach(cosine similarity method), using the clustering methods to classify a industry.
1. Fixed industry classification.
Firms are grouped together using *fixed product market definitions and industry membership is constraint to be transitive*.

2. Text-based network industry classification(TNIC).
Explain differences in key characteristics such as profitability, sales growth, and market risk across industries.

It allows both within-industry and across-industry relations be to examined.

*** Methods:
computing pairwise word similarity scores for each pair of firms in a given year.

- data:
1. get product descriptions.
2. limit attention to nouns(defined by Webster.com) and proper nouns that appear in no more than 25% of all product descriptions in order to avoid common words.
3. omit common words that are used by more than 25% of all firms, omit geographical words including country and state names, as well as top fifty cities in the US and in the world.

- algorithm
Clustering Based On Distance Matrix
1. Hierarchical clustering
In data mining and statistics, hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:

Agglomerative: This is a "bottom up" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.

Divisive: This is a "top down" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.

$$ V_i = \frac {P_i}{\sqrt {P_i* P_i}}$$
$$\text {Product Cosine Similarity}_{i,j} = (V_i * V_j)$$
$$\text {Product Cosine Distance}_{i,j} = 1-  (V_i * V_j)$$

**** industry classification
- fixed industry classification based on 10-Ks product descriptions
maintain consistency with other fixed classifications such as Standard Industry Classification.

running a clustering algorithm.

hold these industries fixed throughout samples(from 1997 to 2008).

assign firms to these industries in later years based on their 10-K text similarity relative to the frequency-weighted list of words.

- 10-K based TNIC
define each firmi's industry to include all firms j with pairwise cosine similarities relative to i above a pre-specified minimum threshold.

focusing on thresholds generating industries with the same fraction of membership pairs as SIC-3 industries in an unbiased fashion.

 a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1w}\\
